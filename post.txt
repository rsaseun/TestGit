Though it might be hard, I will get there.
It might be so tough, I am tougher.
It might rained intensely, I will get dried up surely.
It might be unbearable, Jesus has given me the best definitely.

It won't be hard beyond me.
It won't be beyond my God's strength.
God has gone ahead of time to fix up things for and in me.
It is not about me all the time but about His unlimited capabilities.
He is stronger than the stronger, 
He is higher than the very highest,
He is better than the very best.
There is no comparison with the terrible but he sees everything.
He can do beyond my prayers, requests. 
And yes He is God able to provide everything for His children who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all. 
He that is ablbe is above all. 

Yes! There goes my God.
