Life as a journey of Johnny:
Though it might be hard, I will get there.
It might be so tough, I am built tougher.
It might rained intensely, I will get dried up surely.
It might be unbearable, I am tenacious.

It won't be hard beyond me.
It won't be beyond my God's strength.
God has gone ahead of time to fix up things for and in me.
It is not about me but about His unlimited capabilities.
He is stronger than the strongest. 
He is higher than the very highest.
He is better than the very best.
There is no comparison with Him as He exceeds all.
He can do beyond my prayers, requests.
And yes! He is God able, exceedingly abundantly above all. 
He that is above is above all.
Yes! There goes my God.

He has the smoothness of it all,
He has the best of maps to navigate the stormy waters.
Whoever intends to exceed the limits must align with the unlimited One.
No matter how hard the journey is for Johnny,
Johnny has got to put his journey to the One with road map to success.

We are all Johnny on earth.
Our travels and travails are the same - unpredictable.
We have a guarantee that when we connect to the source, we have the resource.
Stay connected to Him who has the right compass to travel safely.
Peace as you harken and joy as you travel.
